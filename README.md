## Project Name
Find-a-Mentor

## The Problem
Beginning a career as a software developer can be a daunting task if you have no one to guide you. There is so much to learn in the software field about coding and applications that it often leaves a junior developer overwhelmed. The initial days as a developer are full of struggles but are equally crucial too. This is the time when you need to work on setting your foundation right. However, many would-be and junior developers are lacking in this area which is directly affecting their output in their place of work. 

## Solution
An experienced mentor who has faced similar situations and problems in the past can make your journey comparatively easy. The mentor can guide you to the right resources, tell you what is important, and help you develop strong core skills. 

Therefore, **Find-A-Mentor** is a free platform platform that aims to connect software developers and mentors in Nigeria. This project was born out of a desire to provide a platform to connect mentors and mentees at no cost.
